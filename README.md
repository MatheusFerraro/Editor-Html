# Editor-Html
## This was a project where I implemented string manipulations
-------------------------------------------------------------------

# Challenges 
* I used Regex to add <strong> </strong> tags
* My challenge was to change the colour into the strong tags to bold them, continue the normal colour of the words after the tags, and maintain the normal colour before the tags.
* Another challenge was the user writing, breaking lines, and saving them in a path. All of these were made into my menu, which was acting like paper, utilizing the Cursor position for the type of user starting in the middle of the menu.
* Add an Esc(Escape) key to act as an option to exit the menu and save the typed text into a file text using a directory path.

## Utilization of Methods, Class and keywords
* StringBuilder
* Console Foreground Color, Console Color
* Utilization of substring
* Cursor Position
